## Quick Notes


## `ECS-based 2D Render Pipeline with Rust Wgpu`
This game system is the most intricate and evolving project I have worked on in my past experiences.

I have designed a technical architecture using the `ECS` pattern, outlining a high-performance approach adopted by the game companies I previously worked with. This design effectively manages the complexity of `Game Data`, `Gameplay`, and `2D UI interactions`, providing a robust, efficient, and maintainable foundation for building games.

To align with the job description, I will focus on the `ECS-based 2D Render Pipeline using Rust and Wgpu`.
